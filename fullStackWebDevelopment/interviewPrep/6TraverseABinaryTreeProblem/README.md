# Traverse A Simple Binary Tree

Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree, such as a
binary tree or binary search tree, exactly once. There are several effective
traversal algorithms which I will cover below.

All of the algorithms below will implement Node objects I create, which
were covered in a previous algorithm on linked lists. Although, I will be
slightly changing the code for the nodes. The tree I will be operating on
looks like the following:

And I can assume the tree is properly constructed via the following code
which sets up nodes and links them to their proper child nodes:
