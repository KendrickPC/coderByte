# Traverse A Simple Binary Tree

Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree, such as a binary tree or binary search tree, exactly once. There are several effective traversal algorithms which we will cover below.

All of the algorithms below will implement Node objects we create, which were covered in a previous algorithm on linked lists. Although, we will be slightly changing the code for the nodes. The tree we will be operating on looks like the following:
